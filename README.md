# javaLava

I have challenged [James](https://github.com/JamesB0907) to a duel...

While attending NewForce, we both became familiar with C#, but have never coded in Java.

We've both given ourselves a week to create a Java CLI text based game. 

Hopefully this will be a fun exercise (fueled by competition) that will familiarize us with the syntactic nuances of the two languages.
